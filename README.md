# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Data-Related-Job-in-2020
Data science has been called “the sexiest job of the 21st century”. As an information science student, I regarded data science related work as my future career option and have paid constant attention to the job market. There are people being optimistic about the field, while others warn that this area has been overweight. Thus, I hope this research could be helpful for understanding the demand situation of data-related job in current job market.  
In the meanwhile, I use this analysis to solve a few questions that I face when looking for jobs. When I look at the job posting platform, I notice that the requirements for data scientists are different from companies to companies, and even constantly changing in the job market. It also troubles me when I notice that different companies have their own way to call a position. Thus, I hope to explore more about the data science job market and provide hits for students who are finding data science related jobs.
